            <ul>
                <li>✅ Your privacy comes first - I genuinely don't collect any data because I don't have servers!</li>
                <li>✅ All data stays on your device - I couldn't access it even if I wanted to</li>
                <li>✅ I'm responsive to feedback - if you find issues, I'll fix them</li>
                <li>✅ This is a passion project built with care for families like mine</li>
                <li>✅ No tracking, no ads, no monetization of your data - ever</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you have any concerns or find anything that doesn't work as described, please contact me. I'm learning and growing as a developer, and your feedback helps make this app better for everyone.</p>
